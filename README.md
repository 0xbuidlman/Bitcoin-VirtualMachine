# Machine image builder focused on Bitcoin

This repository is made of three technologies, Packer, Vagrant and Ansible, that allows us to create a Ubuntu 18.10 
Virtualbox image (and Vagrant box) with a few stuff for Bitcoin / Lightning Network. 
The image is ideal for Bitcoin workshops, hackathons, etc. 


## What is inside

The VirtualBox image itself is not included in this repository, you need to generate it yourself with the `packer build` command, see below.
It usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours, depending on your internet connection and the speed of the Ubuntu mirror server.

### Operating System

Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic - desktop version.
The [preseed.cfg](packer/http/ubuntu-desktop/preseed.cfg) file is used to do an automatic install.

### Softwares

- Bitcoin Core (latest) from the [Bitcoin PPA](https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin) 
  - Using the bitcoin.conf from the BitcoinJS guide
  - Set on Regtest mode

- Lightning Network  
  - LND
  - c-lightning  
  
- Wallets
  - Electrum  

- Terminal
  - ZSH (Antigen)
  - Tilix
    
- Code editors
  - Brackets
  - Vim

- Programming languages, compilers, ...
  - C
  - Node.js (v10)
  - Go (v1.11.5)  

- Various libraries
  - Libbitcoin-explorer (bx)
  - JQ


You can deactivate installation of what you don't want by removing roles in the main [playbook](ansible/playbook.yml).


### BitcoinJS guide

Included right on the desktop is the extensive [BitcoinJS guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-Programming-with-BitcoinJS)
made by StÃ©phane Roche from Bitcoin-Studio. You can explore it to learn how to do all kinds of Bitcoin transaction.


## How to launch the VM

There are two ways to launch the VM, from VirtualBox or from Vagrant.

In the `packer/outputs` directory, you can open the `.ovf` image to import it into VirtualBox, or you can import the 
`.vmdk` image from VirtualBox.

With Vagrant, you have to add the Vagrant box to Vagrant and run it. See below.


## How to login

There is only one user, username: `bitcoin`, password: `bitcoin`. 
It has sudo access without password!
There is no `root` user.
When you launch the VM it has auto-login feature activated.

If you want to connect in command-line from the host machine, you can do it with `vagrant ssh`, see below.


## How to generate a VM image 

We use Packer to create the VirtualBox virtual image and a vagrant box.
Ansible is used to provision the virtual image.

### Packer

Generate the virtualbox image and the vagrant box
```
$ cd packer
$ NAME=ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64 UBUNTU_CODENAME=cosmic packer build -force ubuntu-desktop.json 
```

And with more logs 
```
$ PACKER_LOG=1 NAME=ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64 UBUNTU_CODENAME=cosmic packer build -force -on-error=ask ubuntu-desktop.json
```

#### Setting a Ubuntu mirror server

If the OS installation is too slow you can set an other Ubuntu mirror in the 
[preseed.cfg](packer/http/ubuntu-desktop/preseed.cfg) file, choosing one close to your location.
> Line: d-i mirror/http/hostname string MIRROR

### Vagrant

Add the box to Vagrant
```
$ vagrant box add --name ubuntu1810-bitcoin packer/outputs/ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64-virtualbox.box
```

Launch the VM
> We need to cd into `./vagrant` because the ssh keys are there, and to have everything Vagrant related in this directory
```
$ cd vagrant
$ vagrant init ubuntu1810-bitcoin
$ vagrant up
```

Run the Ansible provisioning against the vagrant box
```
$ vagrant provision ubuntu1810-bitcoin
```

Print the Vagrantfile included in the box
```
$ tar -O -xf packer/outputs/ubuntu-18.10-desktop-amd64-virtualbox.box Vagrantfile
```

#### SSH connection to VM via vagrant

Generate a new ssh key pair
> I place them into `./vagrant` directory, named `vagrant-rsa` and `vagrant-rsa.pub`
```
$ cd vagrant
$ ssh-keygen
> Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/steph/.ssh/id_rsa): vagrant-rsa
```

The script [vagrant.sh](packer/scripts/linux-common/vagrant.sh) is used by Ansible to copy the ssh public key to the VM. 
The key is hardcoded there, change it if needed.

If you want to copy the ssh public key to the VM manually
```
$ cd vagrant
$ cat vagrant-rsa.pub | ssh bitcoin@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod -R go= ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Establish a SSH connection
> If the SSH keys are ok you should not be asked for a password
```
$ vagrant ssh
```

#### Shared folder

Vagrant allows you to have a shared folder between your host machine (at `vagrant/shared`) and the guest VM 
(at `/home/bitcoin/Desktop`).

You need to install vagrant-vbguest
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Ansible

Create a new role with all the boilerplate
```
$ ansible-galaxy init ROLE
```

Check playbooks syntax
> It is useful to execute it before running a packer build
```
$ cd ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```
